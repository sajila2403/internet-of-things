Industrial Internet Of Things Industry + Internet + Things = Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

The IIoT represents industry-oriented applications where:

● Devices are gadgets functioning in industrial, transportation, energy, or medical environment.

● Data quantity and rates tend to vary from sustained to relatively high.

● Applications are safety-critical, for example, the misbehaving of a smart traffic system can threaten drivers.

● IIoT applications tend to be system-centric. Consumer + Internet + Things = Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT)

The CIoT is a category of consumer-oriented applications where:

● Gadgets are consumer devices, for example, mobile, refrigerator, glasses, etc.

● Data quantity and rates are comparatively low.

● Applications are not very critical, for example, failure of fitness gadgets will not harm you.

● CIoT applications are consumer-centric. General use of IOT:
